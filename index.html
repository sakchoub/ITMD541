    <h1> Web application development </h1>
    <p> In this course students examine core web technologies that are integral in the
        creation of web-based applications typically delivered in a browser. The course will cover
        fundamental web protocols, web application architectures, markup, and scripting languages. A focus
        will be placed on writing modern, standards-compliant JavaScript and how it is used to interact with
        HTML and CSS to enable rich user interfaces and communication with other services. Current
        frameworks, libraries, and tools will also be explored </p>
