                    In this course students examine core web technologies that are integral in the
                    creation of web-based applications typically delivered in a browser. The course will cover
                    fundamental web protocols, web application architectures, markup, and scripting languages. A focus will be placed on writing modern, standards-compliant JavaScript and how it is used to interact with HTML and CSS to enable rich user interfaces and communication with other services. Current frameworks, libraries, and tools will also be explored.
